### Key Components

- `SeatLayoutComponent`: Handles the visual representation of seats
- `SeatService`: Manages seat booking logic and state
- `seat.model.ts`: Contains interfaces for Seat and BookingResult

## Usage

1. Enter the number of seats you want to book (1-7)
2. Click the "Book Seats" button
3. The system will:
   - Attempt to book seats in the same row
   - If not possible, book nearby available seats
   - Display booking confirmation with seat numbers
   - Update the seat layout visualization

## Booking Rules

1. Maximum 7 seats can be booked at once
2. Priority is given to booking seats in the same row
3. If same-row booking is not possible, nearby seats are allocated
4. Seats are allocated sequentially when possible
5. Last row contains only 3 seats

## Color Coding

- Green: Available seats
- Red: Booked seats

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in the `components` directory
2. Add services in the `services` directory
3. Define interfaces/types in the `models` directory

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Technical Details

- Framework: Angular 18
